Testing notes: need it on 32 bit machine & 64 bit

All the install and update CODE exists in processProgress.cs, it's hard to understand w/o historical context but important questions to ask yourself include how the 
schema that is being used is referenced. An example would be the three execute query methods in processProgress.cs. They do not have a default schema in the connection
string so you will need to reference the schema in the query (such as SELECT * FROM SCHEMANAMEHERE.Mouse; for executeMultipleResultsQuery or ALTER TABLE SCHEMANAMEHERE.GenotypeDocument 
DROP INDEX `_GenotypeDocument_key`  ;

Upgrading upgrader: 

1.Create script to upgrade to that latest version, add it to the upgrade scripts folder and right click, select properties, and Copy to output directory to 
'Copy Always'. Also make sure that it's included in the installer project. 

2. In program variables, change latestJCMS to whatever the latest versionNumber of JCMS is (4.6.0, 5.0.0, 5.1.0 or whatever). 

3. To the end of the list of upgrade scripts being added to the upgrade scripts linked list in the initialize() method of the programVariables class add 
yours as follows: upgradeScripts.AddLast("TheNameOfYourScriptGoesHere"); 

4. Lastly, in the intialize method of the programVariables class add a mapping for the new version of JCMS after the most recent one as follows: 
upgradeMap.Add("versionNum.Goes.Here", ++index); You may notice that some indexes aren't increased, this is because it not every version had a schema change so
for example to upgrade from 4.0.0 and 4.0.1 you still just need to run the same scripts.

Upgrading installer:

1. Replace interface file with latest interface file, make sure the name stays constant

2. Add the most recent documentations.

3. If any more items are added, add them to JCMSExtras and take necessary steps os they are installed. 

4. In programVariables.cs add following line installScripts.AddLast("this_is_the_name_of_your_install_script.sql"); at the end of the list of similar lines.
